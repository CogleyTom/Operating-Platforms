# Operating Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
**The gaming room application required multiple teams to guess what image was being drawn from random stock images. One instance of the game and 
each player is only allowed once, this required the use of singleton classes.**

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
**There were many things I did particularly well. However, understanding the development requirements for each platform and conveying it was what I did the best on.**

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
**Creating the domain model and UML diagram helped the most when developing the code. Understanding how my program was supposed to behave was very important.**

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
**If I had to choose one part to revise it would be the recommendations section. I feel like I could add more data in there and many more comparisons so my client
can understand the differences between the platforms.**

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
**I understood how the user wanted their App to run. I then created my domain model based on what the user wanted, such as, separate teams, 
separate players, and no name the same. It is important to consider the user's need when designing because it is their program. Creating a 
program that accomplishes everything the client wants is how we finish a project.**

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
**I approached the desing aspect by looking through what the client wanted on their App. I then created my UML diagram so I could see the proper flow
of my program. I then began to develop it. In the future I would use the exact same approach to design a software application.**
